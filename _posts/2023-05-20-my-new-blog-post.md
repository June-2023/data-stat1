## This is my blog post, I am learning how to use it.
What do you think being a data scientist is about?
A data scientist is a scientist to collect data, digests data with models, and then derives valuable information. They are usually trained in computer science, mathematics/statistics, and other specific knowledge.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
The major duties of a data scientist are to work on data science, specifically gathering data, ingesting massive data, data cleansing and transformation, data cleansing, creating models, and getting valuable insight.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
The knowledge areas of a data scientist include computer science, mathematics/statistics, and other specific knowledge.

Both data scientists and statisticians use statistics and complement each other, data scientists need the help of statistics from statisticians, and statisticians need the help of data scientists when dealing with a high-dimensionality data set.  Normally, statisticians need the knowledge of modeling and structure of data, and data scientists need the knowledge of applied statistics.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I work on biotechnology and hope to apply the knowledge of data science and statistics to my future work, the combination of biotechnology, data science, and statistics might be suitable for me.
